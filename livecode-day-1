FLEXBOX: A CSS3 layout mode that provides and easy and clean way to arrange items within a container. Used for mobile friendliness and responsiveness!

Remember, content flows down in a column. We have to change this using FLEXBOX

Flexbox-> Pay attention to parent div and child div relationship.

You can change the direction. Default with flexbox is horizontal (x axis). But you can determine the direction of the flex!

flex-direction: column, row, etc.
justify-content: flex-end, center, space-between, space-evenly, etc

align-items: center, flex-start, flex-end, etc

flex-wrap: To WHERE the flow will go if the screen size changes!

flex-wrap: wrap;

align-content: flex-start, space-around, etc

child elements can be ordered with order: 1,2,3, etc property.
